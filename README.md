# BitChute_Mobile_Android_BottomNav
BitChute classic Android with OpenGL video encoding

Go to bin/release and click on the .apk to download the latest app.
Once the app has been downloded go to "My Files" and click on the .apk
Click install and you've got the app.

This app was recently suspended in the GPS so it will likely soon be abandoned, 
although I will keep posting updates until another opensource bitchute client becomes available.

I can't really justify this level of work when it won't ever get used.  
I'll be focusing on infrastructure stuff for BitChute.com rather than app
that can be arbitrarily banned at will for political and social control reasons.
I never really wanted to dump a lot of time into an app when I knew this would happen. 

Information is dangerous, when it's not controlled by a handful of oligarchs,
and I won't ever stop fighting for human freespeech. -hexagod
